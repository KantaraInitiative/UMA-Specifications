      <t>This extension specification defines a mechanism for a User-Managed
      Access (<xref target="UMA" />) V1.0.1 resource server to register
      multiple requested permissions at an UMA authorization server, not just
      a single one.</t>

      <section title="Notational Conventions">
        <t>The key words 'MUST', 'MUST NOT', 'REQUIRED', 'SHALL', 'SHALL NOT',
        'SHOULD', 'SHOULD NOT', 'RECOMMENDED', 'MAY', and 'OPTIONAL' in this
        document are to be interpreted as described in <xref
        target="RFC2119" />.</t>

        <t>Unless otherwise noted, all protocol properties and values are case
        sensitive. JSON <xref target="RFC7159" /> data structures defined by
        this specification MAY contain extension properties that are not
        defined in this specification. Any entity receiving or retrieving a
        JSON data structure SHOULD ignore extension properties it is unable to
        understand. Extension names that are unprotected from collisions are
        outside the scope of this specification.</t>

    <section anchor=""
             title="Extension to How Resource Server Registers Requested Permissions With Authorization Server">
      <t>The resource server is assumed to need to use the protection API's
      permission registration endpoint under all the same circumstances as
      defined in the base UMA specification. This extension specification
      defines a mechanism for allowing an array of one or more requested
      permissions.</t>

      <t>Note: A future minor revision of the UMA specification could
      potentially incorporate this extension as long as the non-array option
      is preserved; the non-array option could be eliminated only in a future
      major revision of the specification because it would be backwards
      incompatible.</t>
